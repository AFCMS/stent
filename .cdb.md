> Code has been build by [MisterE123](https://github.com/MisterE123) to help me with the [2023 Minetest Game Jam](https://jam.minetest.net)

A formspec based arena entrance type for arena_lib.

An example menu is included.

Typing annotations for [LuaLS](https://luals.github.io) are included in the code (doesn't rely on any Minetest specific headers).

Checkout the [documentation](https://github.com/AFCMS/stent/blob/master/README.md#how-to-use)
