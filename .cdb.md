> Code has been build by [MisterE123](https://github.com/MisterE123) to help me with the [2023 Minetest Game Jam](https://jam.minetest.net)

A new arena entrance for `arena_lib` that can be implemented in a formspec.

An example main menu is included.

Typing annotations for [LuaLS](https://luals.github.io) are included in the code (doesn't rely on any Minetest specific headers).
